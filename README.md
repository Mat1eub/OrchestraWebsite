# OrchestraWebsite

Welcome to our repository! This project is a collaborative effort between two friends aiming to learn how to build a website from scratch. Our goal is twofold:

1. **Learn Web Development:** We want to acquire the skills needed to create websites by exploring both front-end and back-end development. This will expand our knowledge and push us to gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development.

2. **Build Something Useful:** While learning, we want our efforts to serve a real purpose. The website we create will be used by a student flat-share project (*kot-à-projet*) in Louvain-la-Neuve. Here's what we aim to achieve:
   - **Event Management:** Since the project regularly organizes events, the website should allow for easy event presentations and updates.
   - **Music Lessons Database:** Maintain a database of students in Louvain-la-Neuve who are looking for music lessons, as well as a list of qualified teachers and their contact information. The website will help the *kot-à-projet* connect students with teachers efficiently.

### Future Plans
As we learn more and dedicate time to the project, we anticipate coming up with additional features to implement. These may be:
- Useful for the *kot-à-projet* community.
- Personal curiosities to explore new web development concepts and techniques.

# How to Use This Repository
This repository will contain:
- Code for the website’s front-end and back-end.
- Notes and documentation about our learning process.
- Ideas for new features and updates.

Feel free to suggest some ideas as we build this project!
